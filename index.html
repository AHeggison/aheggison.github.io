<p>Exploring use of computer vision techniques to enable automated measurement of volcanic sulphur dioxide flux, and provide informed estimates of the uncertainty.</p> 

<h2>Project Background:</h2>
<p>Since the early 2000s, UV camera technology for measurement of volcanic sulphur dioxide emission rates has developed, allowing for an increasing number permanent installations. 
<a href="https://www.volcanotech.co.uk/">The Volcanology group at The University of Sheffield</a> have designed low-cost PiCam units, with a variety of installations across the globe. 
Collectively these cameras return vast amounts of data, which is very time consuming to process manually. 
Multiple groups have developed techniques for automating some or all processing steps for these large batches of data (CITATIONS HERE).
In this project we aim to develop reliable techniques for understanding data quality, making the most of computer vision to inform processing decisions and enable improved uncertainty quantification. 
Techniques are explored an tested on data from six volcanoes around the globe, with the intention of selecting methods which generalise well to new locations or camera installations. 
<p>
<h2>First step: Data Quality Asessment</h2>
<p>Ideally, all retrieved data would look like the example above: well lit with a a clear background sky, defined plume and nothing obscuring the recording.
However, this isn't always the case...

<h2>Current Progress:</h2> 
<p>We've been exploring the use of convolutional neural networks to identify two of the cases illustrated above: an obscured camera lens, and cloud interacting with or obstructing the view of the plume.
Networks pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset are fine-tuned using manually classified samples, to output a "lens-obscurance" index and "cloud obscurance" index.
Models are being evaluated for ability to generalise to data from unseen volcano locations, and prediction accuracy on new data from volcanoes seen in training.

    </figure>
  </div>

The training process for baseline versions of these models is illustrated above. The prediction accuracy on the validation set increases with training epochs until the model has learned all the helpful information it can from the given data, at which point the accuracy levels off or decreases. We hope to improve these results futher through hyperparameter tuning, and expansion of the labelled dataset (described below). Currently predictions are generally strong on the most and least obscured data, but there is more error near the decision boundary. The results vary at different volcanoes too, as shown below.

    <img src="WebpageImages/Kilauea ValidationSet Cloud Index Predictions.png" alt="" style="width:100%">
    <figcaption>The predictions of the cloud index on data from Kīlauea are really bad! Cloud often slightly mixes with the plume, and doesn't lie over the flank so this data looks significantly different to other locations. </figcaption>
    </figure>
  </div>
  <div class="column2">
    <figure>
    <img src="WebpageImages/Merapi ValidationSet Cloud Index Predictions.png" alt="" style="width:100%">
    <figcaption>However at other locations, in this case Merapi, the accuracy is very strong. In particular, all of the manually labelled "Very" and "In Calc" (affecting the area where absorbance is calculated) data is identified strongly by the index.</figcaption>
    </figure>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="row">
  <div class="column2">
    We found that the main limitation on the performance of the models in many cases was the labelled training dataset given. 
    However, manually labelling the terabytes of data available is not possible, and would make model training impractical as the dataset size increased.
    Therefore we are working on selecting key, informative samples for aditional manual labelling, using information provided by the features of the existing models. New examples are selected from areas of the feature space not well represented in the current dataset.

<h2>Future Work:</h2>
Next planned steps include experimentation with automation of further processing steps (e.g. plume segmentation for background light estimation), and uncertainty quantification. 
This area of work has potential for use with other UV volcano camera systems, aswell as wider application e.g. to visible wavelength volcano camera data.
